                Sushi, a Japanese culinary art, features vinegared rice combined with varied ingredients. 
                Classic forms include Nigiri, small rice beds with fish or seafood atop, and Maki, rolls wrapped in 
                seaweed with rice, fish, and vegetables. Sashimi, thin slices of raw fish, is also popular. Creative 
                variations like Dragon Rolls and Rainbow Rolls showcase sushi's adaptability, offering a 
                delightful fusion of flavors and textures.
